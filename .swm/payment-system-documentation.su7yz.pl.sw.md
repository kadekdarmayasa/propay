<!-- Intro - Do not remove this comment -->
Propay Payment System is a web application for managing school EDC (Education Developmnet Contribution) payment.<br/>
This system is using manual payment.

Manual payment that I mean is the user(admin) will input the payment amount when there are students want to pay it.
